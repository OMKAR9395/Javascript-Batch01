1. Data Types
	Declare a variable with a number value and print its type using typeof.
	Concatenate a string and a number and observe the output.
	Create a boolean variable, change its value, and print it.2. Operators
	Take two numbers and apply arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %).
	Compare two numbers using relational operators (>, <, ==, ===, !=).
3. Functions
	Write a function that adds two numbers and returns the result.
	Create an anonymous function to multiply two numbers.
	Use an arrow function to find the square of a number.
	Demonstrate a function with default parameters.
4. Arrays
	Create an array of 5 student names and print them using a loop.
	Find the maximum number from an array.
	Remove duplicate values from an array (hint: use Set).
5. Objects
	Create a student object with properties: name, age, and marks.
	Use for...in to print all properties of the object.
	Create a nested object (student with address) and print the city property.
6. for loop
	Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
	Print only even numbers from 1 to 20.
	Print the following star pattern:
	*
	* *
	* * *
	* * * *
7. while loop
	Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
	Find the sum of digits of a number (e.g., 123 â†’ 1+2+3=6).
	Keep asking for a password until it is correct (simulate with attempts).
8. do...while loop
	Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do...while loop.
	Write a program that prints "Welcome" at least once regardless of the condition.
9. for...in loop
	Create a car object with properties (brand, model, year) and print them.
	Use for...in on a nested object and print inner properties.
	Use for...in on an array and print the indices.

ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Array Inbuilt Methods â€“ Assignments
1. push() and pop()
	Create an empty array. Use push() to add 5 student names into it.
	Remove the last element using pop() and print the updated array.
2. shift() and unshift()
	Create an array of fruits. Remove the first fruit using shift().
	Add a new fruit at the beginning using unshift().
3. slice()
	Create an array of 10 numbers. Extract the first 5 numbers using slice().
	Extract the last 3 numbers using slice().
4. splice()
	Create an array [10,20,30,40,50]. Remove the element at index 2 using splice().
	Insert two numbers at index 1 using splice().
5. concat()
	Concatenate two arrays [1,2,3] and [4,5,6] into a single array.
	Concatenate an array of fruits and vegetables.
6. join()
	Convert an array of characters ['J','S'] into a string "JS".
	Create an array of words and join them with a space.
7. sort()
	Create an array of numbers and sort them in ascending order.
	Sort an array of strings alphabetically.
8. reverse()
	Create an array [1,2,3,4,5] and reverse it.
	Reverse an array of characters and join them into a string.
9. indexOf() and includes()
	Create an array [10,20,30,40]. Use indexOf(30) to find the index.
	Check if 50 is present using includes().
